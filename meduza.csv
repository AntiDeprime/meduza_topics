0,"On March 12, the State Council of Tatarstan voted in favor of major changes to the Russian Constitution, falling into step with other regional parliaments whose approval was needed to move toward a nationwide vote on the amendments. In every region, legislators voted for the changes almost unanimously — even on a nationwide scale, there were only a few negative votes. One of them was the singular “no” among Tatarstan’s deputies: Rkail Zaidullin, a member of the United Russia faction (but not the associated party, which is politically dominant in Russia). Zaidullin said he specifically objected to the clause in the proposed amendments that calls ethnically Russian people foundational to the Russian state. Meduza special correspondent Andrey Pertsev spoke with the legislator and asked him to elaborate on his views.  Did you vote against the constitutional amendments because of the clause on the Russian ethnos as foundational to the Russian state? Yes, and I spoke during the hearing to criticize [that clause]. After all, we’re not the only ones seeing a lot of debates over that change; the same thing is happening in other national republics. It’s just that most deputies are part of a “united” party: They might be against it in their souls, but they vote along the party line. You’re also part of the United Russia faction, but you voted no. Did others try to convince you to vote in favor of the amendments? I have been speaking out about that clause for a long time. Even on a logical level, I couldn’t find any way to approve it — that would have meant going against myself. A faction’s a faction, but I have my conscience, too. Just before the [voting] session, when the [United Russia] faction members got together and decided to vote as a bloc, I abstained — I’m not in the party, see. My colleagues in the faction took my vote calmly. They know I’m a writer, a free person; they also react just fine to my speeches because they know I say what I think and do what I say. There was no pressure on me either before or after the vote. Does the Constitution’s current language about Russia as a multiethnic people meet your standards? Exactly — right now, that’s what it says: Russia is a federation, and that doesn’t infringe on or detract from the rights of the Russian ethnos in any way. Nobody doubts the greatness [of the Russian people] — we’re all children of Russian culture and literature, of Pushkin, of Tolstoy. Why write that into the Constitution? We shouldn’t be thinking in sixteenth-century categories! Right now, the separation of church and state is codified, but the amendments have a clause about God over a thousand-year history. There’s no need for that in the Constitution, in my opinion. Sulustaana Myraan, a deputy in the Yakutian parliament from United Russia, not only voted against the amendments but also resigned her post. Have you heard about her? I have, and her opinion is noteworthy as well, but it’s never too late [to resign]. The amendments are being passed as a set, and that set includes clauses on the Russian government’s system of power: the State Council, zeroing out presidential term counts, and so on. What do you think about those measures? I’m critical of them as well. There should be alternation of power in a democratic society, right? I’m not familiar with all the intricacies of politics, of course, but why do we need a State Council, too? We’ll have to rename our own State Council [i.e. the legislature of Tatarstan]. Maybe they did think it all up just to zero out the [presidential] terms. I don’t know. But they want to introduce the concept of federal territories into the Constitution. If a given territory is considered important, then it can be controlled directly by the federal government separately from the other subjects of the [Russian] Federation. That’s also problematic, and it’s against federalism. I’m for the Russian Federation, so I’m against amendments like those.","‘A faction’s a faction, but I have my conscience, too’ Why a Tatar legislator from the bloc representing Russia’s ruling party voted no on the new constitutional amendments","6:30 pm, March 13, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/13/a-faction-s-a-faction-but-i-have-my-conscience-too

According to an announcement from Russia’s federal task force, air travel will now be limited to flights destined only for the capital cities of EU nations, though the new rules do not apply to charter flights, according to the news agency Interfax.

2,"As Russia’s confirmed COVID-19 case count continues to hover in the mid-double digits, large companies and cities outside Moscow are beginning to take precautions. St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov announced that from March 16 to April 30, all events involving more than 1,000 people will be banned. The surrounding Leningrad region, meanwhile, banned events of over 300 people following its first confirmed case: a woman from Kudrovo who had recently visited Italy. Large Russian corporations, including state corporations, are beginning to take precautions as well. In many cases, those measures remain relatively mild. The oil and gas company Gazprom recommended that its employees “refrain from traveling frequently abroad,” an anonymous source told Interfax. While employees will continue to work in person, meetings involving more than 10 people will be held by videoconference. At Russian Railways, meanwhile, corporate leaders asked their employees to suspend nonessential travel outside Russia but did not appear to take additional preventative measures. Yandex, a Russian tech giant whose services echo Google’s, has gone further than its peers, telling its employees to work from home for at least a week if possible. The company has also told workers to avoid public transit if they do come to work, offering to compensate them for taxi rides.

4,"Putin administration spokesman Dmitry Peskov says the Kremlin is taking all necessary steps to protect the president from seasonal and other diseases. On Friday, the press secretary fielded questions from journalists about whether the administration is pursuing additional measures, after reports a day earlier that one of the lawmakers who attended the president’s speech on Tuesday had violated Russia’s rules on self-quarantine, following his return from an undisclosed trip to France. Peskov explained that the president’s medical treatment is comprehensive, regardless of Russia’s epidemiological situation, meaning that Putin is monitored and protected from all conceivable illnesses. Peskov also expressed confidence that the president had no direct contact with the State Duma deputy in question, who also hasn’t tested positive for coronavirus or exhibited any symptoms of the disease. Asked if Putin plans to undergo testing for the coronavirus as a precaution, Peskov said he doesn’t know, while also insisting that details about the president’s health aren’t meant for general public consumption (though federal law says this information is not subject to classification). Peskov also asked any journalists who think they might be sick to stay away from events attended by Vladimir Putin.","Kremlin spokesman says Putin is safe from coronavirus, but don't expect to see his medical records","1:10 pm, March 13, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/03/13/kremlin-spokesman-says-putin-is-safe-from-coronavirus-but-don-t-expect-to-see-his-medical-records

Dmitry Peskov, Kremlin spokesman: No, there’s no reason to do that.

I’ll say it again: the maximum number of presidential terms is established in the Constitution. It’s not disappearing from there. And it’s just that, based on the current situation, a one-time exemption was suggested in relation to the current president.

7,"Meduza has learned that media manager Demyan Kudryavtsev and his business partners have found potential buyers for the newspaper Vedomosti, one of Russia’s leading business-oriented publications. On Wednesday, March 11, the newspaper’s owners signed an agreement expressing their intention to sell. According to Meduza’s sources, ownership of Vedomosti may pass to Alexey Golubovich, the founder of the investment company Arbat Capital, and to Nikolai Zyatkov, the former editor-in-chief of Argumenty i Fakty (Arguments and Facts) and current president of the tabloid publisher Nasha Versiya (Our Take). 
Disclaimer: Tatiana Lysova, Meduza’s first deputy editor-in-chief, is on the board of directors for Vedomosti and served as the newspaper’s editor-in-chief until 2017. She did not participate in the preparation or editing of this story.  Demyan Kudryavtsev and two of his business partners, Vladimir Voronov and Martin Pompadur, purchased the business newspaper Vedomosti in 2015. Now, two sources told Meduza, the entrepreneurs are nearing a sale agreement for the outlet. One of our sources learned of the forthcoming sale from the newspaper’s buyers, and the other received information about the deal from the sellers. Both said that on Wednesday, March 11, the two sides signed a letter of intent. The sources added that Vedomosti’s potential buyers are investment firm founder Alexey Golubovich and former Argumenty i Fakty (Arguments and Facts) Editor-in-Chief Nikolai Zyatkov. Now that an agreement has been signed, the due diligence process for Vedomosti is set to begin, according to one source who spoke with Meduza. That procedure entails a check on the financial and legal state of Vedomosti’s assets. We were unable to determine the sum for which the newspaper will be sold: Both the source familiar with the sellers and the source close to the buyers said the agreement signed on March 11 includes a set of conditions that will later affect the final size of the deal. Those conditions include developments in currency values (the ruble has devaluated rapidly in recent days) as well as Vedomosti’s own financial indicators. About a year ago, the business newspaper Kommersant reported that Vedomosti would likely be sold for approximately the same price assigned to it in 2015; that is, 15 million euros ($16.8 million). One of our own sources confirmed that the sum in question is “no less than that.” Arbat Capital founder Alexey Golubovich has been in negotiations to purchase Vedomosti for more than a year, but both of our sources said the talks have been “on and off.” “He would alternate between moving toward Kudryavtsev and stepping away. Just couldn’t make the final call. And then Zyatkov showed up, but he took it slow as well. Ultimately, Demyan introduced them in the hope that they would finally commit together,” one source said. Golubovich’s interest in purchasing Vedomosti was indeed reported about a year ago, but the investor denied any involvement in negotiations at the time. Voronov, Pompadur, and Kudryavtsev purchased Vedomosti in 2015 from the newspaper’s foreign shareholders (Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, Financial Times publisher Pearson, and the Finnish media conglomerate Sanoma) shortly after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law limiting foreign shareholders to 20-percent ownership in Russian media companies. Kudryavtsev said at the time that his family had bought shares in Vedomosti while his business partners purchased debts from previous shareholders, meaning that Vedomosti was placed in Voronov and Pompadur’s debt. However, in 2017, Kudryavtsev lost his Russian citizenship, meaning that he was no longer legally permitted to own the newspaper. The business database SPARK-Interfax indicates that Business News Media, Vedomosti’s publisher, was transferred in that year to Kudryavtsev’s wife, Yana Mozel-Kudryavtseva, through her own joint-stock company, Arkan Investment. In February 2020, however, Kudryavtsev told the channel RTVi that ownership of Vedomosti had been transferred again, this time to the “family” of his business partner Vladimir Voronov. Both of Meduza’s sources asserted that the shift to Voronov’s ownership was a mere formality. “It’s not so important who the legally registered owner of the newspaper is. For instance, it’s Demyan [and not Voronov or Pompadur] who’s holding talks with the new buyers. It’s pretty obvious that there’s a kind of agreement between the three partners here, and they’ve all retained a financial interest in the publication,” one source explained. Anonymous sources had also previously confirmed to the economic outlet The Bell that “transferring the paper from one [business partner’s] relatives to another’s was probably a technical necessity dictated by personal circumstance” and that “no real sale of Vedomosti has yet taken place.” What we know about the potential buyers Alexey Golubovich owns the investment firm Arbat Capital, which he founded in 2007. In the early 1990s, he worked publishing finance papers and later took over the investment branch of Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s Menatep banking group while working as a top manager at Khodorkovsky’s ill-fated Yukos oil company. In 2004, Golubovich was federally and internationally wanted in a fraud case that was heard separately from the case against Yukos itself. In early 2007, Golubovich voluntarily returned to Moscow. According to Kommersant, Russian prosecutors had promised to drop the charges against the investor in exchange for testimony against Yukos shareholders Platon Lebedev and Leonid Nevzlin as well as Khodorkovsky himself. Golubovich was subsequently listed as a witness in the Russian government’s second case against Yukos. At first, Golubovich’s testimony appeared to bolster the defense, but just a day into his hearings, the investor walked back his previous statements and gave new testimony that favored the prosecution. Nikolai Zyatkov was editor-in-chief at the weekly newspaper Arguments and Facts from 2002 through 2016. In 2002, Zyatkov was also the paper’s co-owner, holding a 24-percent share in its associated joint-stock company. A few years later, however, 99 percent of Arguments and Facts was purchased by Promsvyazbank, itself owned by the wealthy Ananyev brothers, Alexey and Dmitry. Both are currently wanted in an embezzlement case involving their own bank and have hidden abroad rather than facing prosecution in Russia; Arguments and Facts was ultimately incorporated into the Ananyevs’ Media3 group. Soon after his deal with the two brothers, Zyatkov bought Our Take from the widow of journalist Artyom Borovik, who founded the tabloid in 1998 as Top Secret Take. One of Meduza’s sources emphasized that most of Zyatkov’s wealth is derived from the sale of his share in Arguments and Facts. The most recent available data in SPARK-Interfax actually indicates that as late as 2012, Zyatkov still owned an 0.2 percent share in the paper. In 2014, the firm Moscow Informational Technologies, which is owned by the Moscow government, purchased Arguments and Facts, and the identities of the publication’s shareholders are no longer public knowledge. Zyatkov left Arguments and Facts in late 2016 by a mutual agreement with the publication’s leadership. In 2017, he became president and chief editor for the media publisher Our Take, whose eponymous tabloid had already belonged to him for a full decade. The paper has expanded from Moscow to St. Petersburg, Saratov, the Northern Caucasus, Chuvashia, Bashkiria, Tatarstan, and Kirov. Zyatkov owns 100 percent of Dialan, Ltd., which holds the trademark for Our Take. Following his departure from Arguments and Facts, Nikolai Zyatkov worked alongside his son, fellow media mogul Konstantin Zyatkov. The younger Zyatkov owns the domain for Novaya Versiya (New Take) through the firm Versiya (Take), Ltd. He is also the CEO of Our Take. In a 2016 interview with Our Take itself, Konstantin Zyatkov said the following about his newspaper: “Fortunately, Our Take clearly stands out from numerous other publications. It just so happens that all of our writers are Russian patriots. […] Even in our critical pieces (where we don’t give a pass to thieving bureaucrats), we don’t sink into despondency and empty negation. Constructive criticism is what a lot of people like. It was extremely pleasing that members of the ONF [All-Russia People’s Front] contacted us to add a bit to their critical baggage, but of course, our line is a good deal further along than theirs.” According to SPARK-Interfax, Take, Ltd.’s revenue in 2018 was 100 million rubles (about $1.6 million), and 70 percent of that was profit. Dialan, Ltd. made 107 million rubles (about $1.7 million) in 2018, with 12 million (about $193,500) remaining as profit. What the buyers and sellers say When Meduza asked Demyan Kudryavtsev whether he had really signed a letter of intent to sell Vedomosti, the entrepreneur responded, “That’s incorrect. I haven’t made an agreement with anybody to sell Vedomosti.” Vladimir Voronov also denied that an agreement had been reached. However, he said he could neither confirm nor deny that he had negotiated with Golubovich and Zyatkov. “Negotiations have been held with a range of people,” he said. Alexey Golubovich did not respond to Meduza’s calls. Nikolai Zyatkov told us that he had not signed an agreement to buy Vedomosti, nor had he taken part in negotiations to do so. His son, Konstantin Zyatkov, told Meduza that there is no letter of intent and that he has not been involved in talks to buy Vedomosti. “That’s interesting. We’ll keep an eye out.

13,"On March 10, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin issued an order cancelling all large public events in the Russian capital due to the escalating coronavirus outbreak. The order dictates that, at least until April 10, all “athletic, spectator, public, and other mass events” involving more than 5,000 people will not take place. For example, the Crimean Spring Festival celebrating Russia’s annexation of the peninsula has been shut down. In the period between now and April 10, Egor Kreed and Till Lindemann (among others) were set to perform in Moscow, protesters were preparing to march against Vladimir Putin’s proposed constitutional changes, and a number of major sports events were scheduled to take place. Meduza surveyed all the coronavirus FOMO Muscovites will be forced to feel in the coming month.  Politics Moscow’s public event ban includes a rally supporting radical constitutional changes proposed by Vladimir Putin and his supporters. Yevgeny Fyodorov, a State Duma deputy who also coordinates the National Liberation Movement, told Interfax that the rally will not take place on Tverskaya Street on March 15 as planned. “Yesterday, due to the coronavirus, the mayor of Moscow made the decision to issue a ban on mass events involving more than 5,000 people, and we were planning to have something like 300,000 or 400,000 people. And we must be guided by [the mayor’s decision-making]. Therefore, we had to cancel the rally.” The “Civil Society” movement, which had planned to lead a protest against the proposal to “zero out” Vladimir Putin’s and Dmitry Medvedev’s presidential term counts, has applied to Moscow City Hall to change the conditions of that protest. Organizers hope to limit the number of participants to 4,500 people, libertarian politician Mikhail Svetov wrote on Twitter. Civil Society initially planned to hold two protests: one that would “demonstrate the objections of Russia’s citizens to the passage of new changes to the Russian Constitution” (including the presidential term count nullification) and another that would voice concerns about two criminal cases against young people accused of radicalism (the Network case and the New Greatness case). Those protests were planned for March 21 and 22 on Sakharov Prospect, and each was initially designed to include about 25,000 people. Other protest permit requests were submitted by Tatiana Usmanova of Open Russia, Maria Kuznetsova from the Party of Change, and Yevgeny Ovcharov, the head of an organization called Team Egor Zhukov. Those requests described a potential protest on March 21 involving 50,000 people, and organizers have not yet announced how their plans for that event have changed. Music A number of Moscow venues with a capacity above 5,000 people had scheduled major concerts for the month between March 10 and April 10. The Megasport stadium, which can house an audience of 14,000, was set to host rapper Egor Kreed on March 21. That performance has been cancelled: Yevgeny Finkelshtein, who directs the Planeta Plyus promotion company responsible for the event, notified the business radio outlet BFM.RU about the cancellation. The Megasport show would have been Kreed’s first major concert in Russia following the musician’s exit from fellow rapper Timati’s Black Star label. Despite the cancellation, tickets for the concert are still available for purchase online. Another show by the Rammstein-PAIN crossover band Lindemann is also under threat. The performance, scheduled for March 15 in the BTV Arena, would be the fourth in the group’s Russian tour. Lindemann’s managers decided to find a way out of their coronavirus bind by scheduling two back-to-back concerts for 5,000 people each within a single day. The concert organizers noted that anyone attending the first of the two concerts, which is scheduled for 3:00 PM, will receive a free seat category upgrade. On March 20, the rock band Chaif is scheduled to celebrate its 35th anniversary in the same venue. The band’s press attaché, Marina Zalogina, told the radio station Govorit Moskva (Moscow Speaks) that Chaif’s team is discussing a potential cancellation but has not yet made a final decision: “We don’t know yet ourselves,” she said. Smaller events are also under pressure due to the mayor’s order. These include a performance by the French singer Garou at the State Kremlin Palace (6,000 seats), a March 27 concert by the rapper Allj at Adrenaline Stadium (7,000 seats), and a March 28 concert by Nothing but Thieves at the same venue. On April 4, Adrenaline was also meant to host the Foucault’s Pendulum festival featuring GONE.Fludd, Obladaet, Morgenstern, and other popular rappers. Some promoters have gotten around the event ban by limiting ticket sales to 5,000 per event, as will be the case on March 14 when the band Scooter performs at Adrenaline, according to Interfax. Crocus City Hall, a 7,300-seat venue, will evidently be hosting concerts by Leonid Agutin and Uriah Heep as planned. The arena is technically located in Krasnogorsk, outside Moscow’s borders. Sobyanin’s order does not provide instructions for organizers handling events with fewer than 5,000 attendees (though the risk of infection at such events does seem to be significantly lower) or in other often-crowded public areas such as malls, galleries, and public transport hubs. Moscow City Hall did not respond to Meduza’s request for clarification on this issue by press time. Sports Five Russian Premier League soccer matches were set to take place in Moscow before April 10: CSKA – Ufa (March 14), Lokomotiv – Orenburg (March 21), CSKA – Zenit (March 22), Dynamo – CSKA (April 5), and Spartak – Ufa (April 5). It is not yet clear how the Russian Football Union (RFS) will respond to Sobyanin’s event ban. After a set of March 11 negotiations with individual clubs, the RFS only announced that it had asked the Moscow government for additional clarification. Following those talks, one source told the news agency R-Sport that the clubs themselves will be charged with controlling how the matches are organized and who is permitted to attend them. Among the soccer clubs themselves, only Lokomotiv commented immediately on the situation: Its representatives floated the idea that the team’s match against Orenburg could be transferred out of Moscow to the nearby city of Khimki. TASS reported that some matches could be played either in Khimki or in Ramensky, where the Saturn soccer club has its home stadium. However, later in the day on March 11, the Russian Premier League announced that all matches would in fact take place as planned at their respective teams’ home venues. The audience for each match will be limited to 5,000 people. The Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) is currently in the midst of its annual playoffs, which include the Moscow teams Dynamo, Spartak, and CSKA. The league held an emergency meeting with representatives from each club but did not reach a final decision about whether to postpone its matches or hold them without spectators. A match between Spartak and Dynamo is scheduled for March 12, and the league has asked Moscow City Hall for official clarification on whether or not Sobyanin’s limitations will apply to the playoff. CSKA, meanwhile, has temporarily suspended ticket sales for its home matches. The CSKA basketball team, which has six home games scheduled in the EuroLeague and Russia’s BTV League during the next month, chose to limit its audience to 5,000 spectators using restricted ticket sales. The team plays in Megasport, where some sections of the stands will simply be blocked off.",COVID cancel culture Whose concerts and which protests are getting shut down under Moscow’s blanket ban on large public events,"10:49 pm, March 11, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/12/covid-cancel-culture
14,"On March 11, both houses of the Russian Parliament passed legislation proposing major constitutional reforms. The second and third articles of this draft law specify the mechanisms by which the constitutional amendments would be adopted. The procedure laid out here is highly unusual and involves an assessment by the Constitutional Court and a nationwide vote, neither of which has been done before or codified in any previous law. Meanwhile, Russia’s Central Election Commission is already moving forward with preparations for the nationwide vote. Meduza asked legal scholar and “Golos” council member Arkady Lyubarev to weigh this bizarre legislation’s compliance with Russia’s Constitution and put it in the context of generally accepted democratic standards.  What’s being proposed Article 136 of Russia’s Constitution says any revisions to chapters 3 through 8 of the Constitution must be made according to the procedure prescribed for the adoption of federal constitutional law. This means that adoption requires the votes of at least two-thirds of the deputies in the State Duma and at least three-quarters of all Federation Council members. From here, according to Article 136, the amendments enter into force, after they’ve also been approved by the regional legislative authorities in at least two-thirds of Russia’s constituent territories.  With the new constitutional reforms, however, only the third article of the legislation will enter force after the law wins the necessary approval of the regional legislative authorities. This third article states that the president appeals to the Constitutional Court with a request to review the legislation’s compliance with the Constitution’s first, second, and ninth chapters. The legislation gives the court seven days to reach a decision. If the court rejects the legislation, all the amendments do not enter force and the nationwide vote is canceled. If the court upholds the legislation, the ruling enacts the law’s second article, which provides for a nationwide vote called by the president. If more than half of all votes are cast in favor of the legislation, the constitutional amendments laid out in the bill’s Article 1 (including the revision that “zeros out” Putin’s term clock) will enter force. Otherwise, the law and all its constitutional revisions are rejected.  What are the legal problems here? The vote’s timing The very idea of holding a nationwide vote on constitutional amendments probably doesn’t violate the Constitution’s Article 136. The constitutionality of the procedure specified in the government’s new law, however, is questionable. The fundamental question here is: when should the vote be held? If it had been held, say, after the Federation Council’s adoption but before Russia’s regional parliaments considered the legislation, there’d be no noticeable contradiction with the Constitution. People vote and express their opinion. Then, on the basis of their constituents’ stated wishes, each region’s legislative body would decide whether or not to support the amendments. It would be both democratic and legally irreproachable. But the voting proposed here occurs only after the representative institutions capable of adopting amendments have had their say. If voters support the reforms, there won’t be a problem. But what if they oppose the amendments? The federal authorities should at least entertain this possibility. The legislation says the constitutional reforms do not enter force, in this event, but Article 136 of Russia’s Constitution doesn’t provide for the non-enactment of amendments adopted by the State Duma, Federation Council, and two-thirds of all regional parliaments. The Constitutional Court’s role One problem with the Constitutional Court’s role is the same as with the nationwide vote: it comes too late in the amendment process. But there’s another issue here, as well. The court’s actions are regulated by Article 125 of Russia’s Constitution and corresponding federal laws, none of which grants the court such powers. The one-week deadline is also legally dubious. The issue is simply too important to justify such a short deadline.  A nationwide vote instead of a referendum Article 3 of Russia’s Constitution states that the referendum and free elections are the highest direct expressions of the people’s authority. What about a “nationwide vote”? The Constitution says nothing about a “nationwide vote” as an expression of the people’s authority. In fact, a nationwide vote on constitutional amendments falls within the scope of referendums described in Russian law. In other words, it’s a referendum in all but name. Lawmakers aren’t calling it a referendum, however, for one simple reason: the proposed rules for conducting this vote strongly diverge from the norms codified in Russia’s federal constitutional law on referendums. That’s why the authorities came up with something new that has no existing constitutional definition. Russian law guarantees quite extensive rights to citizens participating in a referendum, and the public is now being denied those rights. These guarantees concern the verification of the issue submitted for a referendum, rules for campaigning both “for” and “against” the proposals at hand, rules for financing these campaigns, and a procedure for voting and counting votes with monitoring by representatives of different political forces, as well as responsibility for violations of the law. Instead of this, lawmakers rushed to think up abbreviated voting rules and crammed them into the second article of the reforms bill. The Central Election Commission should clarify a detailed voting procedure in a document called “The Procedure for Preparing and Conducting the Nationwide Vote.” The project already adopted by the commission, however, severely truncates many norms found in election and referendum laws that establish control over the voting process. First and foremost, this concerns control over early voting and home voting. When discussing the project at the Central Election Commission, several experts have already drawn attention to this. What the commission will ultimately decide here remains unclear, but officials so far have demonstrated little interest in providing such oversight.  Voting on unrelated amendments Besides compliance with the letter of Russia’s Constitution, it’s also worth asking if the proposed voting procedure conforms to democratic principles. The amendments in question are a set of unrelated norms (or “blocks” of norms). When making his state-of-the-nation speech and proposing the constitution revisions in the first place, Vladimir Putin divided the amendments into seven blocks. Lawmakers later added more amendments that weren’t linked to these blocks.  In these actions, the president clearly violated a clause in Russia’s federal law on adopting and enforcing constitutional amendments, which requires that one law encompass interlinked constitutional revisions (this, incidentally, is how two unrelated amendments were introduced in 2008 — as two separate draft laws). Later this year, Russians will be asked to vote either for or against the entire package of amendments, and people who support some of the revisions but not other amendments will be deprived of the opportunity to express their will. Officials at the Central Election Commission have already compared this all-or-nothing voting scheme to a fixed meal, but this is a flawed analogy. After all, someone who shows up for a fixed meal probably wants four courses. And if that person doesn’t eat something, nobody comes out and shoves the leftovers down their throat. Kremlin political strategists, by contrast, are trying to hitch unpopular ideas to proposals that are widely supported. Voters will have no chance to reject specific pieces. In this case, neither society nor the authorities will know which amendments enjoyed genuinely conscious public support and which passed as “included with purchase.”",Not very How legal is the mad dash to overhaul Russia’s Constitution?,"5:50 pm, March 11, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/11/not-very

26,"On March 9, while Russian markets were closed following International Women’s Day, the value of the ruble on the online exchange Forex plummeted, leaving the Russian currency at 75 per dollar and 85 per euro. When the Moscow Exchange closed on Friday, it only took 68 rubles to buy a dollar and 80 to buy a euro. The prices of Russian stocks on the London Stock Exchange also took a nosedive today. The ruble’s rapid depreciation was caused by a collapse in oil prices Monday morning: The cost of oil fell by 25 percent, the largest single-day change in the twenty-first century so far. Brent brand oil now costs less than $35 per barrel, bringing the price of oil below Russia’s budgetary rule — the lowest price officials assume when composing the country’s federal budget. This means the Russian government has shifted from accumulating reserves to spending them. However, the cause of the current price drop is also at Russia’s feet: Its government refused to support OPEC countries in their proposal to cut down oil extraction in order to stabilize prices. It is likely that the ruble’s current decline will continue, but how long the currency’s value continues to fall will depend on the length and severity of the global coronavirus outbreak. Dmitry Kuznets explains.  Is this just an economic scare, or is it a crisis? Neither. Experts believe that when official markets open in Russia on March 10 (with their far larger numbers of buyers and sellers relative to London and Forex), the ruble’s decline will continue, as will the devaluation of Russian stocks. With oil prices as they are, a drop to 72 – 78 rubles per dollar is inevitable: When oil prices fall for an extended period of time, the ruble becomes 3 percent cheaper for every 10 percent decrease in oil markets. Since December 2019, oil has lost about half its monetary value, meaning that a drop in the ruble of 15 percent or more is simply to be expected. A corresponding outflux of foreign investors could exacerbate that fall. Within the past year, investors have actively bought up Russian bonds thanks to their high profitability, a result of current Central Bank monetary policy. Now, the drop in oil prices will lead most investors to sell out, trading their bonds for rubles that they can use to purchase dollars. The central protective barrier holding off a further collapse in the ruble’s value is Russia’s conglomerate of economic institutions. The Central Bank had been buying rubles from the Finance Ministry on a daily basis to keep their price low, but it has now cut off those purchases to produce a slight cushioning effect as prices collapse. The Central Bank also has the ability to decrease the supply of rubles by increasing its key interest rate for the first time after a long period of decreases. For its part, the Finance Ministry has announced that it will begin selling dollars from Russia’s National Wealth Fund. At least on the surface, the current situation looks similar to previous oil-driven declines in Russian markets during 2014 and 2016. In both cases, drops in ruble and stock values led to economic crises that brought about decreased production and income throughout Russia. This time may be different, however: Russia is better prepared for an oil shock than it has ever been before. Its national reserves are extremely high, much of its government’s income is in dollars (making ruble devaluation advantageous), and many of its budgetary expenditures are in rubles. Meanwhile, Russia’s inflation levels are at historic lows (about two percent per year), meaning that the Central Bank may even welcome a rise to 3.5 or four percent. The potential advantages of ruble devaluation for Russia in 2020 also extend to international economic relations. Russia’s dependency on imports (which grow in cost when the ruble declines) is much lower than it was in 2014, which will protect Russian consumers from sharp price increases. Russian producers will also benefit as it becomes easier for them to compete with international rivals. All that said, declining oil prices will obviously bring about losses for Russia as well. Its citizens’ real incomes could drop, and its government will likely be forced to postpone the large outlays it has been planning for the massive national projects requested by President Vladimir Putin. Why did Russia allow oil prices to drop? Would the fall even have been avoidable? The primary cause of the current collapse in oil prices is the novel coronavirus outbreak. The budding epidemic decreased demand for fuel, especially in China (one of the world’s main oil consumers) and among airlines. Oil-producing countries could have resisted that decline in demand by decreasing supply — that is, by cutting down extraction rates. Stopping some oil production is a tried-and-true collapse prevention method: A conglomerate consisting of the OPEC countries and other major oil producers like the U.S. and Russia has made the decision to cut supply multiple times in recent years. Last week, during consultations for that conglomerate (known as OPEC+), Saudi Arabia proposed a massive decrease in oil extraction to 1.5 million barrels per day, but the plan was conditioned on Russia’s agreement. That decrease was also meant to be extended following a treaty expiration on April 1; after that date, global extraction rates could have decreased to just over 500,000 barrels per day. Moscow responded to the Saudi plan by proposing a much smaller production decrease, and on March 9, negotiations officially fell apart. Saudi Arabia subsequently announced that it would ramp up extraction rather than decreasing it and that it would offer buyers a discount on crude oil through the month of March. That price war stems from the current distribution of oil markets: Major figures in the Russian oil industry, especially Rosneft head Igor Sechin, believe that OPEC and the United States are aiming to profit from current global circumstances at Russia’s expense. However, Russia’s starting position in the fight is stronger than that of its opponents. While the Saudi budget can only be balanced at oil prices of around $80 per barrel, Russia’s requires just half that price. Moscow likely decided that a price drop amid the COVID-19 epidemic was inevitable in any case, leading its government and oil industry to switch into a “controlled crisis” mode as soon as possible. From here, the country can only wait for the coronavirus to retreat or for Saudi Arabia to return to the negotiating table. In the meantime, economists expect nosediving oil prices to cost Russia about 0.5 percentage points of economic growth. The International Energy Agency predicts that oil demand will rebound to a normal level in the second half of this year. If the epidemic spins out of control around the world, however, Russia’s economy will take a bigger hit than almost any other. According to calculations from Bloomberg, the outbreak may cause a 4.8 percentage point decrease in annual GDP growth, sending the country’s economy into a deep recession.",Black Monday The ruble is nosediving thanks to a coronavirus-triggered oil price collapse.

27,"The number of COVID-19 cases detected per day outside of China has long surpassed the recorded infection rate within Chinese borders. Nonetheless, between January 1 and March 5, 2020, Russia reported only four confirmed cases of the disease [Update: as of March 13, that number reached 45]. Only one of the four cases was found in Moscow, the second-largest city in Europe after Istanbul. Meanwhile, in Italy, France, and Germany, there were 3,089, 337, and 444 confirmed cases respectively as early as March 5 (updated figures are available here). This is despite the fact that the number of passengers who have traveled to those countries from China by air is comparable to the number traveling to Russia. While it’s impossible to say with certainty how this disparity arose, it is possible to offer a few potential explanations. Whether you believe them is up to you.  Hypothesis 1: Russia closed its borders fast enough that almost nobody infected with the virus could get in The Russian government first increased its control over individuals arriving in the country from China on January 23, 2020, but it did not limit any means of transport until January 31. On that day, Russian officials closed off direct trains from Moscow to Beijing and closed its ground border with China to foot traffic and automobiles. By then, 9,923 cases of COVID-19 had already been registered worldwide, both in China and in Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Even in Finland, which has a very small interchange of transit passengers with China and a large one with Russia, had registered cases. All this means that at least in theory, the new coronavirus had every opportunity to enter Russia before transportation to and from China was limited. In fact, it did just that: The first two infections recorded in Russia were detected on January 31 in two Chinese citizens traveling as tourists. Hypothesis 2: At first, Russia just got lucky, and then limits at the border did their job Despite Russia’s suspension of rail and auto traffic with China and its February 18 ban on Chinese citizens entering Russia at all, air traffic between the two countries has continued: Russians can go to China and come back. Of course, people are coming down with the new coronavirus in plenty of other countries, too. Seventy-seven people are reportedly dead in Iran; assuming a (conservative) fatality rate of one percent for the illness and a two-week infection period, one can guess that there were 5,000 – 10,000 people infected in the country two weeks ago. However, Russia only introduced aviation limits with Iran on February 28, by which time that number had probably doubled. Similar reasoning applies in South Korea (2,337 recorded cases by February 28), Italy (888 cases), Singapore (93 cases), and other countries where Russia did not introduce any limits at all. All this means the new coronavirus had ample opportunity to enter Russia after February 1 as well as before it, and with a few insignificant caveats, those opportunities remain open to this day. Whether they allow the coronavirus to take hold in Russia is another question. Hypothesis 3: Russia managed to find everyone carrying the virus Rospotrebnadzor, Russia’s consumer welfare agency, publishes a daily bulletin tracking its efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic. That bulletin indicates that since January 31, when Russia directed all air traffic from China to Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, 382,155 individuals arriving from China have been examined, and 130 of them were found to have symptoms of infectious diseases. When Meduza requested comment, Rospotrebnadzor indicated that all of those individuals were isolated, but none were found to have the new coronavirus. Isolated cases of the flu and other infections were detected instead. This all sounds well and good, but there may have been false negatives in testing (see below), to say nothing of coronavirus infections that are asymptomatic. If an infected individual does not show symptoms, they are not tested or counted in Rospotrebnadzor’s statistics unless they later seek medical help on their own. How often COVID-19 is latent and whether it’s infectious if it does not cause symptoms are still open questions, but epidemiologists have issued estimated answers. For example, a group of scientists at Imperial College London analyzed air travel data from China to various countries, assuming that the proportion of infected passengers traveling from China was identical for each destination country. When the epidemiologists also assumed that countries like Singapore, which detected the highest infection rate among Chinese arrivals, had in fact detected every infection, they concluded that about two thirds of cross-border coronavirus cases have remained undetected. There are flaws to this methodology, especially because the researchers used flight statistics from 2016 and did not take travel restrictions into account. However, the fact that Italy and Russia typically have similar air traffic flows from China does not bode well for Russia. Hypothesis 4: Russia isn’t using the best available test for the virus In Russia, lab tests are being conducted using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) diagnostic panel kits produced by a Novosibirsk-based business called Vektor. However, the protocol for using that kit differs significantly from the testing systems in place in other countries, Meduza found. We obtained a copy of the Vektor-PCRrv-2019-nCoV-RG protocol and compared it to analogous methods from developers in the U.S., Germany, France, Japan, Thailand, and elsewhere. Hypothesis 5: The number of coronavirus cases recorded in Russia is a vast underestimation, but most patients haven’t needed medical help When we asked clinical infectious disease specialist Valentin Kovalev to comment on the situation surrounding coronavirus diagnoses, he expressed certainty that people infected with the new virus have in fact entered Russia. “I think the coronavirus infection got to us from China a long time ago, and a lot of people have already contracted it. However, we don’t know about those cases because most of the time, the infection feels just like any other ordinary respiratory illness, and people who are infected get better on their own. Nobody here is about to routinely check everyone who comes down with a cold at home.” Kovalev pointed out that only laboratory testing can truly confirm the presence of the virus and that in asymptomatic cases, where individuals carry the virus without experiencing a fever or respiratory problems, only post-facto antibody testing typically does the trick. “Theoretically,” he said, “we could find every case if we carry out complete tests for everyone who has a cold. That’s not happening, but it wouldn’t make much sense, either.” Meanwhile, evolutionary biologist Georgy Bazykin of the company Skoltekh gave Meduza a more positive but less certain prognosis. Bazykin said he “doesn’t have a good answer” as to why Russia has so far avoided a mass outbreak. “It’s possible that someone brought in [the virus] but got better without infecting anyone,” he speculated. “It’s possible that there are a lot of undetected cases — some data indicate that about two thirds of all cross-border transfers have not been detected — but I haven’t seen any direct evidence confirming that there are hidden cases in Russia,” he concluded.",Why are there so few reported COVID-19 cases in Russia?,"5:43 pm, March 6, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/06/why-are-there-so-few-reported-covid-19-cases-in-russia
28,"The Italian Embassy in Moscow has posted on Facebook recommending that citizens of Italy avoid traveling to Russia if they are currently displaying even mild respiratory symptoms or fevers. The recommendation stemmed from newly announced anti-coronavirus measures devised by Moscow City Hall. Mayor Sergey Sobyanin has instituted “self-isolation regimes” for anyone arriving from Italy, China, Iran, and a range of other countries affected by the virus. Italian diplomats urged travelers from Italy to consider the fact that anyone violating the new rules may face jail time. Sobyanin has also made clear that Moscow’s facial recognition system is being used to track individuals who are meant to be under quarantine as well as those who come into contact with them.",Italian Embassy tells Italians not to travel to Russia to avoid harsh Moscow quarantine measures,"4:47 pm, March 6, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/03/06/italian-embassy-tells-italians-not-to-travel-to-russia-to-avoid-harsh-moscow-quarantine-measures
29,"During a meeting with residents of Russia’s Ivanovo region, President Vladimir Putin made a series of comments that placed his willingness to yield power following his current term into doubt. The meeting was livestreamed by Rossiya 24. In the course of his exchange with local citizens in Ivanovo, Putin said he believes Russia must achieve more stability and growth before the country establishes a system with regular regime changes. “Now, indeed, perhaps stability is even more important, steady development in this country. But later, when we accumulate… when the country accumulates more self-confidence, more resources… then it will definitely be absolutely necessary, without a doubt, to provide for the alternation of power,” Putin said. He then argued for a strong presidential system, saying Russia does not have “persistent political parties” and that even more established European parliamentary systems have had “very large glitches.” The president also commented on the possibility that he would lead the State Council, a body to which his newly proposed constitutional amendments will likely grant significant powers. If the State Council does become more powerful and he is the one to lead it, Putin said, “that would be fatal for Russia.” “That would mean a diarchic situation. For Russia, that would be fatal,” the president explained, adding that while he “[likes] his job,” he is not willing to “agree to some kind of government scheme that would be unacceptable for the country, that would destroy it.” Putin also raised concerns among opposition members by musing that “anyone, if they found themselves in my position, I am sure, would see it not just as a job, but as fate.”","Putin prioritizes ‘stability’ over ‘alternation of power,’ calls his position ‘fate,’ says he wants to avoid diarchy after 2024","2:51 pm, March 6, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/03/06/putin-prioritizes-stability-over-alternation-of-power-calls-his-position-fate-says-he-wants-to-avoid-diarchy-after-2024
