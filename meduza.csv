0,"The number of COVID-19 cases detected per day outside of China has long surpassed the recorded infection rate within Chinese borders. Nonetheless, since 2020 began, Russia has reported only four confirmed cases of the disease. Only one of those cases was found in Moscow, the second-largest city in Europe after Istanbul. Meanwhile, in Italy, France, and Germany, there are currently 3,089, 337, and 444 confirmed cases, respectively. This is despite the fact that the number of passengers who have traveled to those countries from China by air is comparable to the number traveling to Russia. While it’s impossible to say with certainty how this disparity arose, it is possible to offer a few potential explanations. Whether you believe them is up to you.  Hypothesis 1: Russia closed its borders fast enough that almost nobody infected with the virus could get in The Russian government first increased its control over individuals arriving in the country from China on January 23, 2020, but it did not limit any means of transport until January 31. On that day, Russian officials closed off direct trains from Moscow to Beijing and closed its ground border with China to foot traffic and automobiles. By then, 9,923 cases of COVID-19 had already been registered worldwide, both in China and in Taiwan, Singapore, Australia, the United Kingdom, and other countries. Even in Finland, which has a very small interchange of transit passengers with China and a large one with Russia, had registered cases. All this means that at least in theory, the new coronavirus had every opportunity to enter Russia before transportation to and from China was limited. In fact, it did just that: The first two infections recorded in Russia were detected on January 31 in two Chinese citizens traveling as tourists. Hypothesis 2: At first, Russia just got lucky, and then limits at the border did their job Despite Russia’s suspension of rail and auto traffic with China and its February 18 ban on Chinese citizens entering Russia at all, air traffic between the two countries has continued: Russians can go to China and come back. Of course, people are coming down with the new coronavirus in plenty of other countries, too. Seventy-seven people are reportedly dead in Iran; assuming a (conservative) fatality rate of one percent for the illness and a two-week infection period, one can guess that there were 5,000 – 10,000 people infected in the country two weeks ago. However, Russia only introduced aviation limits with Iran on February 28, by which time that number had probably doubled. Similar reasoning applies in South Korea (2,337 recorded cases by February 28), Italy (888 cases), Singapore (93 cases), and other countries where Russia did not introduce any limits at all. All this means the new coronavirus had ample opportunity to enter Russia after February 1 as well as before it, and with a few insignificant caveats, those opportunities remain open to this day. Whether they allow the coronavirus to take hold in Russia is another question. Hypothesis 3: Russia managed to find everyone carrying the virus Rospotrebnadzor, Russia’s consumer welfare agency, publishes a daily bulletin tracking its efforts to combat the coronavirus epidemic. That bulletin indicates that since January 31, when Russia directed all air traffic from China to Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport, 382,155 individuals arriving from China have been examined, and 130 of them were found to have symptoms of infectious diseases. When Meduza requested comment, Rospotrebnadzor indicated that all of those individuals were isolated, but none were found to have the new coronavirus. Isolated cases of the flu and other infections were detected instead. This all sounds well and good, but there may have been false negatives in testing (see below), to say nothing of coronavirus infections that are asymptomatic. If an infected individual does not show symptoms, they are not tested or counted in Rospotrebnadzor’s statistics unless they later seek medical help on their own. How often COVID-19 is latent and whether it’s infectious if it does not cause symptoms are still open questions, but epidemiologists have issued estimated answers. For example, a group of scientists at Imperial College London analyzed air travel data from China to various countries, assuming that the proportion of infected passengers traveling from China was identical for each destination country. When the epidemiologists also assumed that countries like Singapore, which detected the highest infection rate among Chinese arrivals, had in fact detected every infection, they concluded that about two thirds of cross-border coronavirus cases have remained undetected. There are flaws to this methodology, especially because the researchers used flight statistics from 2016 and did not take travel restrictions into account. However, the fact that Italy and Russia typically have similar air traffic flows from China does not bode well for Russia. Hypothesis 4: Russia isn’t using the best available test for the virus In Russia, lab tests are being conducted using PCR (polymerase chain reaction) diagnostic panel kits produced by a Novosibirsk-based business called Vektor. However, the protocol for using that kit differs significantly from the testing systems in place in other countries, Meduza found. We obtained a copy of the Vektor-PCRrv-2019-nCoV-RG protocol and compared it to analogous methods from developers in the U.S., Germany, France, Japan, Thailand, and elsewhere. Hypothesis 5: The number of coronavirus cases recorded in Russia is a vast underestimation, but most patients haven’t needed medical help When we asked clinical infectious disease specialist Valentin Kovalev to comment on the situation surrounding coronavirus diagnoses, he expressed certainty that people infected with the new virus have in fact entered Russia. “I think the coronavirus infection got to us from China a long time ago, and a lot of people have already contracted it. However, we don’t know about those cases because most of the time, the infection feels just like any other ordinary respiratory illness, and people who are infected get better on their own. Nobody here is about to routinely check everyone who comes down with a cold at home.” Kovalev pointed out that only laboratory testing can truly confirm the presence of the virus and that in asymptomatic cases, where individuals carry the virus without experiencing a fever or respiratory problems, only post-facto antibody testing typically does the trick. “Theoretically,” he said, “we could find every case if we carry out complete tests for everyone who has a cold. That’s not happening, but it wouldn’t make much sense, either.” Meanwhile, evolutionary biologist Georgy Bazykin of the company Skoltekh gave Meduza a more positive but less certain prognosis. Bazykin said he “doesn’t have a good answer” as to why Russia has so far avoided a mass outbreak. “It’s possible that someone brought in [the virus] but got better without infecting anyone,” he speculated. “It’s possible that there are a lot of undetected cases — some data indicate that about two thirds of all cross-border transfers have not been detected — but I haven’t seen any direct evidence confirming that there are hidden cases in Russia,” he concluded.",Why are there so few reported COVID-19 cases in Russia?,"5:43 pm, March 6, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/06/why-are-there-so-few-reported-covid-19-cases-in-russia

The recommendation stemmed from newly announced anti-coronavirus measures devised by Moscow City Hall. Mayor Sergey Sobyanin has instituted “self-isolation regimes” for anyone arriving from Italy, China, Iran, and a range of other countries affected by the virus. Italian diplomats urged travelers from Italy to consider the fact that anyone violating the new rules may face jail time.

2,"During a meeting with residents of Russia’s Ivanovo region, President Vladimir Putin made a series of comments that placed his willingness to yield power following his current term into doubt. The meeting was livestreamed by Rossiya 24. In the course of his exchange with local citizens in Ivanovo, Putin said he believes Russia must achieve more stability and growth before the country establishes a system with regular regime changes. “Now, indeed, perhaps stability is even more important, steady development in this country. But later, when we accumulate… when the country accumulates more self-confidence, more resources… then it will definitely be absolutely necessary, without a doubt, to provide for the alternation of power,” Putin said. He then argued for a strong presidential system, saying Russia does not have “persistent political parties” and that even more established European parliamentary systems have had “very large glitches.” The president also commented on the possibility that he would lead the State Council, a body to which his newly proposed constitutional amendments will likely grant significant powers. If the State Council does become more powerful and he is the one to lead it, Putin said, “that would be fatal for Russia.” “That would mean a diarchic situation. For Russia, that would be fatal,” the president explained, adding that while he “[likes] his job,” he is not willing to “agree to some kind of government scheme that would be unacceptable for the country, that would destroy it.” Putin also raised concerns among opposition members by musing that “anyone, if they found themselves in my position, I am sure, would see it not just as a job, but as fate.”","Putin prioritizes ‘stability’ over ‘alternation of power,’ calls his position ‘fate,’ says he wants to avoid diarchy after 2024","2:51 pm, March 6, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/03/06/putin-prioritizes-stability-over-alternation-of-power-calls-his-position-fate-says-he-wants-to-avoid-diarchy-after-2024

10,"Primorsky Krai, a region located in the Far East of Russia, borders North Korea and China. It has close ties with China through trade and tourism. Chinese workers come to Vladivostok, the capital of Primorsky Krai, to set up small businesses. Many of the goods sold in the region are imported from China. But life in this region has changed drastically since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. The border is on lockdown, flights have been cancelled, and travel restrictions with China are in place. Meduza’s Andrey Pertsev visited Vladivostok to see Russia’s Far East is coping in the context of severed ties, however temporary, with neighboring China.  “Come in, get your haircut!” “You’d really have to have your head in the sand to say that the situation in the region hasn’t changed since the coronavirus epidemic began,” says Konstantin Shestakov, the deputy prime minister of Primorsky Krai. Ties to China are so close here that even people passing through Vladivostok as tourists or visitors can easily spot the transformations. Shops are closed, the doors of cafés are locked, business is suffering. One of the most popular activities among Vladivostok residents is to hang out at Chifanki, or Chinese cafés. Most of these cafés are located at the Sportivnyi Market, known by locals as “Sportivka,” which is near the city center. They can be found both alongside the open-air booths and throughout the indoor shopping mall, sometimes lined up in a row. Competition for clients is fierce. Usually, someone stands outside each café and flags down passersby, advertising their food: “Come eat here! Our dishes are delicious!” In Vladivostok, many of the Chinese business owners have chosen simple Russian names for themselves: One can even find a café called “Sasha and Lena” right next door to another one called “Valera and Lena.” The people outside who promote the cafés sometimes offer small gifts to clients, like a pack of juice. Lunchtime is always very busy, and many Chinese workers who work in nearby shops come here for their lunch breaks. When we visited, the cafés seemed empty. Many Chinese shopkeepers had gone to China to celebrate Chinese New Year on January 25, leaving signs outside their shops explaining when they would be back. Judging by these signs, many were looking to return sometime in mid-February. But then the coronavirus outbreak began. By late January, Russia had closed its Far East border with China and imposed travel restrictions. Flights have been limited. Shopkeepers and café owners do not know when their colleagues could be back, but the most optimistic estimate seems to be late March. Local news outlets have reported on the closure of Chinese cafés, but in fact, most of the cafés located on Sportivka were open when we visited. The people who work there were not eager to chat with us, but some of them told us that there are many Chinese citizens who are still in Russia and who are continuing to work: “Where would they go? Everyone is right there, working. Of course, the dishes on the menu have gotten a bit more expensive, but not by a lot,” said Valery, a fishmonger. Some of the barber shops and hair salons around the city are also closed. Like the Chifanki owners, other Chinese entrepreneurs have opted for Russian names, and the salons sport signs saying “Roma” or “Pasha.” The barbershops that are still in business also have people standing outside, enthusiastically inviting people walking by to come in and get a haircut. Indeed, they retain their clientele. The barbershops are full of people. The only difference between now and the time before the coronavirus is that the salon workers wear face masks. “I’m almost not even scared. After all, the border is closed. Our Chinese people, the ones who are in town right now, haven’t gone anywhere, so they couldn’t have contracted the virus. And here [in this Chinese barber shop], everything is high quality and cheap,” says Ekaterina from Vladivostok, who encountered us just after leaving a salon and seemed very happy with her new haircut. A few of the workers told us that they wear face masks to build trust with clients and to show they are keeping health concerns in mind: “After all, we work closely with people,” they said.  A little help from Korean bloggers “The pigeons on the central square have definitely noticed the absence of Chinese people. Chinese tourists constantly fed them, they liked them for some reason. Now it looks like the birds have even lost weight,” says Viktoria, who words for a private tourist company. In the building where Viktoria works, two of three floors are taken up by a grocery store and souvenir shops. Sellers argue that the border lockdown has had hardly any effect on their businesses. That is because they cater specifically to Korean tourists. We walked into one of the souvenir shops. Visitors from Korea were crowding around the shelves, trying to choose from a broad selection of small vodka bottles and various souvenirs with portraits of Vladimir Putin. “Chinese tourism is mass tourism, they move about in groups, they follow their tour guide. The business owners who work with those tour guides have probably felt the effect of the border lockdown. We haven’t,” says Viktoria. She argues that Vladivostok in fact got very lucky with the timing of the coronavirus outbreak, since many people in China try to spend this time of year with their families at home. “It would have been very different in the summer. If you come to Vladivostok [in the summer] you could have trouble figuring out you’re in Russia, we get so many Asian tourists,” she told us with a smile. Jewelers in the center of town have taken a hit. Gold jewelry is popular among tourists from China. Perfume and cosmetics shops are also having trouble. Like the jewelers, they are concentrated in the Tsentralnyi Supermarket, which is located in the center of town on the main square, in close proximity to the major tourist attractions. “It’s not nice, of course, but it’s true that we don’t have many tourists right now. In the summer it would have all been different, but right now, we don’t feel a huge blow. We really hope everything will return to normal, especially in the summer,” said Maria Zaitseva, who works at the jewelry shop called Biryusa. Her shop was empty. The cosmetics shops have begun to depend on tourists visiting from Korea. “They are very heavily oriented towards bloggers. One blogger posted something on her blog about carrot-based cream, and now everyone wants it. I even came with my family to have a look at the cosmetics shop, to see what that kind of interest looks like. At the cash register, they told me, ‘if you see a crowd of young Korean women, that’s where it is,’” said deputy prime minister Konstantin Shestakov. An employee of Il de Bote, a chain store, told us anonymously that their sales have fallen drastically because their shop is more attractive for tourists from China, while Korean tourists seek out locally made unique brands. A quirky local attraction in Vladivostok, the Museum of the Sea Cucumber, also suffered from the coronavirus outbreak. It is closed for regular visitors, and tour groups can come by only after submitting a special application. The museum workers told us that they usually cater to foreigners, and before the outbreak, about one thousand people would pass through the museum every day. The museum is located in the same building as a supermarket called 7-twelve, which also caters to Chinese tourists and is also closed. Konstantin Shestakov says that the timing of the travel ban is indeed lucky: “In August, every day, around five thousand tourists come from China, but in February, that number would have been just hundreds,” he explains. He also adds that the blow has been softened by an increasing number of Korean tourists, who began taking more interest in Vladivostok in 2019. Now, the city’s numbers of Korean tourists are equivalent to its numbers of Chinese tourists in the period before the coronavirus outbreak. “We get two to three people coming from Korea together, usually young people who want to visit the closest European city and have a nice holiday: the sea, selfies, crab, shopping, theater, bars with live music. Korean social media are full of photos from Vladivostok. We’ve tried to emphasize Korean shows and Korean bloggers here,” Shestakov says. The tomato problem The border lockdown and the quarantine in China have hit virtually every resident of Russia’s Far East in another way: Prices for fruits and vegetables have soared. Cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, Mandarin oranges, and apples are mostly delivered from China. The border closure in early February affected food delivery, and sometimes, residents would come to do their shopping and find empty shelves in the grocery store where the vegetables used to be. The border is now open for food delivery again, and fruits and vegetables have filled up the shops. But they are not cheap, sometimes reaching 300 rubles ($4.70) per kilogram. “Before, prices started at 150 rubles ($2.35) depending on the shop. Now you get the same thing for twice as much. What happened?” a disgruntled shopper at the large supermarket Remi asked us. She said that she does not have any interest in buying vegetables from China at this price, and the issue is not coronavirus. She explained that many locals prefer Russian tomatoes and cucumbers to vegetables imported from China because they are better quality. But not everyone can afford Russian greenhouse vegetables, which start from 400 to 450 rubles ($6.25-$7) per kilogram. Tomatoes from Azerbaijan, which are flown in, cost around 600 rubles ($9.36). At a high-end supermarket called Yuppie, a young man reaches for a bag of lettuce, but is taken aback by the price, which has reached 500 rubles ($7.80). “I don’t often look at prices, but this is way too much,” he says as he turns away from the shelf without his lettuce. Because of the price hike for lettuce in particular, the Vladivostok zoo had to crowdfund part of its animal feed by posting on social media and asking locals to bring lettuce for the animals. “We can see that prices are going up, what can I say,” says Shestakov. He argues that this could provide a window of opportunity for the region to find new suppliers from Kazakhstan or Belarus and to develop its own greenhouses. But exports from the region, according to official statistics, have also fallen. For example, China used to buy live crab from Primorsky Krai, but now, demand has fallen. Public events are cancelled because of the quarantine, and people are not leaving their houses to eat out, so crab is not as necessary.  All but frozen Construction is also facing problems. Two construction sites in Vladivostok, for two Hyatt hotels, have hardly been moving along over the past several years. In 2019, the local government sold the two construction sites to the company Burguduz Park, which belongs to Oleg Deripaska (a billionaire who is rumored to have secretive financial ties with Vladimir Putin). The new company wanted to hire Chinese workers to finish the inside of the hotels and planned to ask for permission to bring 500 migrant workers to Russia (companies must obtain authorization if they want to hire foreign nationals), but the border lockdown has halted these plans. “You won’t get these quotas [authorization for foreign nationals to work] until we figure out the situation with the coronavirus,” said Yury Trutnev, the presidential envoy to the Far Eastern District of Russia. The Hyatt construction sites are practically frozen. “I talked to some representatives for Burguduz, and they are actively looking for new labor markets in order to stick to the schedule they set for themselves – they want the hotels completed by the time the Eastern Economic Forum rolls around,” says Konstantin Shestakov, referring to an annual international forum that encourages foreign investment in the Russian Far East. Vladimir Putin always attends. The coronavirus has caused problems for other major building projects in the region, too. Since 2009, the factory Zvezda (Star), which belongs to the United Shipbuilding Corporation, has been working on a new shipyard that will serve as the site for oil tanker production. The China Communications Constructions Company, a Chinese business, has been working on part of the shipyard — namely, a dry dock set to be the largest in Russia. Several thousand Chinese workers are involved in the project. Some of them have gone back to China for the holidays and can’t come back because of the border lockdown. A source in the regional government told us that they have not yet heard anything from the United Shipbuilding Corporation about this issue. “Chinese workers travel there in waves, so there are still some people left in any case,” said the official. A business owner working in construction in the region told us that a couple of years ago. the border lockdown would have caused far more serious problems: “Before, Chinese workers were involved at each stage of construction, but the economy there [in China] is growing, so they’re coming less often to work for the money we can offer them. For us, it’s also become more profitable to hire workers from Central Asia, who fly here via Novosibirsk. The Hyatt project went for Chinese workers because the Chinese people have been doing everything to high standards for a long time now, and they needed quality.”  “We’re used to epidemics and catastrophes” Local business owners are worried about when the quarantine could end and whether it will last a while. The tourist season usually starts in March, and if the quarantine and lockdown continues, then businesses will face serious losses. But the local government is optimistic: “I have a feeling that by the end of March everyone will forget about this entire thing, everything will go back to normal. Of course, we’ll be left with an aftertaste; we’ll have to shake things up and restore them,” Shestakov predicts. Even so, the local administration has taken measures to show they are ready to fight the coronavirus: Three isolation centers for Chinese citizens have been set up, and hospitals have stocked up on so-called “anti-plague kits.” Far East Federal University dorms were reorganized to create a quarantine space for Chinese students who are due back in March. Russian students have reacted with outrage, since many students were forced to relocate on short notice. There has not been a single coronavirus case in the region so far. You see more people wearing face masks on the streets of Moscow than on the streets of Vladivostok. “We are used to epidemics and catastrophes. Something is always happening in the Far East,” says Veronika, the tourist company worker, and laughs.",On the border How the Russian region most intertwined with China is coping economically amid the coronavirus outbreak,"12:15 am, March 5, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/05/on-the-border

A source in law enforcement told Meduza about the discovery and says the body still needs to be examined further to verify the person’s identity.  According to Meduza’s source, the remains were found near where Artyom Dorofeyev’s body was discovered in November 2017. Both Dorofeyev and Levchenko were friends with several Penza Network case prisoners. Last month, Meduza published an investigative report about the apparent murders of Dorofeyev and Levchenko.

12,"On March 2, Russian State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin announced a series of additions to President Vladimir Putin’s proposed amendments to the country’s constitution. The amendments, introduced into the State Duma by Putin himself, include a measure banning same-sex marriage and a passage outlining the government’s view of Russian history and unity. On March 3, a group of journalists attempted to clarify the meaning of the newly proposed measures in the following conversation with Putin’s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov.  Kommersant FM: Vladimir Putin’s amendments to his own amendments to the Constitution came out [yesterday]. There’s a phrase in that document about the memory of our ancestors who gave us our ideals and our faith in God. Whose ancestors did Vladimir Putin have in mind? Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov: Which section being amended are you referring to? Kommersant FM: The one Vyacheslav Volodin read. As far as I understood, it was a preamble. Dmitry Peskov: I’ll tell you what. The thing is that not all of this information is true to reality. Not all of this information corresponds to what the president introduced. That is, what was published on a large scale yesterday wasn’t true to reality. Let’s continue. I’ll find it in the meantime. [Searches for quote] Kommersant FM: Then could you publish it on the Kremlin’s website or send it out to media outlets so that we can at least understand what Volodin is talking about and what Putin introduced? Dmitry Peskov: You know texts that are introduced like this don’t get published [like other bills usually do]. It’s what’s called an official introduction. However, needless to say, it will be published sooner or later. I just can’t tell you when. Right now, the working group [for Putin’s constitutional amendments] is also continuing to work, and so are the Duma and the relevant committees. Experts, lawyers — everyone’s still working. Kommersant FM: Of course — it’s just that we all heard the announcement from the Duma yesterday that Putin proposed this and that, and now we’re being told that he didn’t actually propose this or that. Dmitry Peskov: No, nobody said “neither this nor that,” and nobody said “this and that,” either. It’s just very important here to go off the specific language [of the proposals]. Some information that appeared in the media yesterday in that respect was not true. Now it’ll just take a while to figure out exactly what information wasn’t true and which facts it misrepresented. Kommersant FM: Maybe you’ve found it by now — the sentence starts with “The Russian Federation, united by a thousand-year history and in testament to the memory of its ancestors, who gave us our ideals and our faith in God as well as the continuous development of the Russian state, recognizes this historically formed governmental unit.” Does that phrase appear in Vladimir Putin’s amendments? Dmitry Peskov: I’m still looking because it’s quite a long text. Kommersant FM: The attorneys we and other news sources have contacted have expressed doubts in the legitimacy of adopting these changes into [the Constitution] because the adoption process contradicts current Russian law. For example, [under the new amendments], the Constitutional Court would evaluate the constitutionality of acts that have not yet been passed, but it has no such right. Dmitry Peskov: That’s a question for the lawyers. However, as you understand, attorneys in the Duma and the presidential administration are actively involved in expert legal analyses of these amendments. So a legal analysis has already been completely conducted here. Kommersant FM: And on what basis did the Kremlin make the decision to circumvent established procedures and pass the amendments through a special process [i.e. through a non-binding nationwide vote as opposed to the binding referendum process described in Russian law]? Dmitry Peskov: I don’t understand the point of the question. This process isn’t prohibited by law in any way. Kommersant FM: What I mean is that there’s a particular process for passing [constitutional] amendments in the law, and what we’ve got is a different process. Dmitry Peskov: But other processes aren’t prohibited. All of these clarifications should be directed toward the working group. Kommersant FM: So the Kremlin doesn’t see any problems in the legitimacy of amendments to the law of the land if there’s a process that’s not provided for… Dmitry Peskov: An expert legal analysis is constantly ongoing. [Finds quote] Look, yes, indeed, “who gave us our ideals and our faith in God.” Yes, that phrasing is in there. Kommersant FM: So whose ancestors did Vladimir Putin have in mind? Dmitry Peskov: Our ancestors, yours and mine. The ancestors of those who live in the Russian Federation. Kommersant FM: And what ideals did those individuals give us? Dmitry Peskov: Our common ideals. Well, that’s implied in the text. Kommersant FM: And which god did Vladimir Putin have in mind, exactly? Dmitry Peskov: I think that will be clarified in due time. Kommersant FM: How? In a separate federal law? Dmitry Peskov: No. I can’t answer that question right now. Kommersant FM: Will our government consequently stop being secular in nature? And how will the government treat atheists if these amendments are passed? Dmitry Peskov: I can’t answer that question right now either. [Pause.] Obviously, the government is not losing its secular nature in any way. Kommersant FM: In what way and at what time will this question regarding ambiguity in [the language about] God and ancestors be resolved? Dmitry Peskov: I can only say that [it will be resolved] in due time. I cannot currently offer you the precise format and the precise timing of these explanations. Kommersant FM: Will it at least be before the amendments are passed? Dmitry Peskov: Well, that should go without saying. Before they’re passed, before they’re voted on, there will be a wide-ranging campaign to elucidate these amendments. Both the president himself and the members of the working group have said this on numerous occasions. Kommersant FM: The amendments also include language about the continuous development of the Russian state and the historical formation of this governmental unit. What is to be done with the more controversial points in our history? For example, does this recognize the unity of the Romanov dynasty and the Bolsheviks who ultimately shot them to death? Dmitry Peskov: Let’s not get into a deep historical discussion here because that’s not my role. I recommend that you contact the members of the working group. Kommersant FM: But it was the president who introduced the amendments. Dmitry Peskov: Yes, of course. But because we’re talking about changes to the Constitution, a juridical evaluation would be appropriate, and I am not qualified to offer such an evaluation. Kommersant FM: I understand. But here, there’s also an aspect of the government undertaking to defend the historical truth. But again, about those controversial points. How should the results of the Civil War be evaluated here? Whose side is the historical truth on — the whites or the reds? Dmitry Peskov: I’ve already said everything I had to say on this topic. I will not be adding anything more at this point. Without a doubt, you have the right to ask these questions. I am simply giving you a hint as to where you can redirect them. Kommersant FM: But it’s not the working group that’s introducing [the most recent amendments]. It’s Vladimir Putin who introduced them. Dmitry Peskov: Yes, but a juridical interpretation is still necessary here. Ekho Moskvy: If you’d permit a clarification question — will this be edited by the president himself, or is this the final text? There are a lot of potential problems [in this version]. Dmitry Peskov: How can something the president has already introduced be edited? The only thing is that right now, the State Duma is conducting an evaluation. Wait a while. With time, there will be explanations and clarifications here. The [Duma’s] deliberations are ongoing. The second reading hasn’t happened yet. But right now, the most important work is being done in the State Duma. Kommersant FM: One more thing — a clarification question about the voting process. Will it be all or nothing, or will [voters] be able to choose individual amendments? Dmitry Peskov: We’ve already provided clarification on that count. Kommersant FM: But you can’t explain it to us yourself. Dmitry Peskov: Because deliberations in the working group are ongoing, I don’t want to provide any conclusions, any clarifications. It would be premature. You and I can go on discussing this for a long time yet. You can see an abundance of topics and interest in those topics. But it’s not a topic for a conference call. Ekho Moskvy: Another clarification, if you please — does this [the new set of amendments] match the president’s vision of what the amendments should be? Dmitry Peskov: And what do you think, that he would introduce something that doesn’t match his vision? Ekho Moskvy: Are you unable to explain these things on his behalf because you don’t completely understand his vision, or what? Dmitry Peskov: I cannot offer an explanation on this matter at this time.","‘Which god did Putin have in mind, exactly?’ In unusually extensive back-and-forth with journalists, Kremlin spokesman engages on questions of God, history, and presidential responsibility for constitutional change","10:26 pm, March 3, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/04/which-god-did-putin-have-in-mind-exactly

It’s also about finding new ways to celebrate the coming of spring that can hopefully garner a few likes on Twitter or VKontakte. For example, in the Leningrad region, one group performed their traditional burning of the chuchelo, a large effigy placed on a stake, using a flamethrower. This group the Tver region didn’t even bother lighting their chuchelo on fire manually. They simply blew it up. The villagers of Nikola-Lenivets have an annual tradition of staging a massive inferno. This year, they built a bridge 20 meters (65.6 feet) high and 66 meters (216.5 feet) long only to set it on fire. In Moscow, meanwhile, acrobats on poles gave revelers directions around Zaryadye Park while looking eerily like dementors from Harry Potter. In Stavropol, the burning of the chuchelo was far from the most spectacular part of the annual Maslenitsa celebration. Instead, the holiday featured an elephant made of bliny that was neither burned nor blown up nor even eaten. In other bliny news, a group of master cooks in the Tyumen region spent 14 years training to flip a blin three meters (almost 10 feet) in diameter and finally succeeded this year.

21,"Vadim Solovyov is a digital artist from St. Petersburg, and his aesthetic obsession is pseudorealism. On Instagram, Solovyov creates CGI images and videos depicting a cyberpunk version of his hometown. Each piece combines the familiar with the alien: pre-fabricated apartment buildings walk around the city on mechanical legs, futuristic flying trains extend over skyscrapers, and robot snowplows grapple with malfunctioning parts. In late February, a video by Solovyov that depicted a drone taking out the trash by emerging from a prefab building went viral, drawing media attention to his work. In an interview with the Russian-language outlet TJournal, the artist said he works on his images and clips during his free time outside his day job. Solovyov also writes his own Instagram posts to flesh out the world of each photo or video. For example, the following clip of a flying patrol station came out shortly before New Year’s with this eerily cheery caption: “It’s extremely naïve to count on really feeling the New Year’s spirit if you live in Petersburg, of course. Today is December 24th, and I’m still carrying an umbrella around in my backpack. Rain, green lawns — it’s not really the winter wonderland you would expect at New Year’s. But it was so great that they came up with this holiday décor for the patrol stations! There’s a Soviet cartoon character painted on every robot! And it just immediately makes your heart a feel little happier somehow. It’s like the scent of clementines is in the air all of a sudden, as though that winter wonderland really is somewhere nearby! ✳️☃️” Another video shows a snow-clearing robot trying fruitlessly to do its job using a small fire after suffering a malfunctioned arm. Solovyov told TJournal that the clip is a reference to the winter of 2018 – 2019, when St. Petersburg city officials failed to clear snow from the streets properly, and the regional governor proposed fixing the problem by handing out shovels to local bureaucrats. It’s not just robots who inhabit the artist’s cyberpunk city.

22,"The Dossier Center, an investigative journalism project by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, has reportedly discovered a guide prepared by the Putin administration for local agitators and media sources to use when discussing the Russian president’s proposed constitutional changes. MBK Media, which is also associated with Khodorkovsky, published excerpts from the talking points. Other sources have not yet verified the authenticity of the document. If the guidelines are authentic, it appears that the Kremlin has divided the Russian populace into six groups for the purpose of promoting Putin’s reforms. The document offers talking points and suggestions for approaching each group, including examples of rhetoric that can be used for canvassing or adapted for media headlines. Group 1: Elderly voters The purported guidelines encourage constitutional reform agitators to win over pensioners and other older Russian citizens by bringing up topics like patriotism, the family, and the futures of their children and grandchildren. The talking points also encourage comparisons between the present day and the economically chaotic 1990s, which allow advocates to “play on fears of instability.” The slogans devised for this group include: Group 2: Patriots The Kremlin reportedly suggests approaching this group using, well, “patriotic motifs” such as defending national sovereignty and establishing the supremacy of the Russian Constitution over international law. Associated slogans include: Group 3: Loyalists The reported administration talking points for this group understandably focus on the president himself, using his accomplishments as president to ask for trust in his choices. Slogans include:  Group 4: Young voters
 According to the Dossier Center, strategies for promoting Putin’s constitutional changes to youth make up the largest section of the Kremlin’s guidelines. The gist of those suggestions is that young people should be told the current vote is a historic one — the reforms represent a new era of change when Russians must “move forward and change the country for the better.” Some of the slogans involved employ contemporary slang: Group 5: Low-income voters In this case, the Kremlin has reportedly chosen to lean into the argument that the proposed constitutional changes will provide social welfare guarantees and improve everyday life in Russia, including for the country’s most disadvantaged classes. Slogans include: Group 6: Putin’s critics The administration guidelines recommend confronting voters critical of the Putin government by arguing that the new constitutional amendments would guarantee regular regime change, protect the government from the errors that accompany individual autocratic rule, and reinforce the separation of powers, enabling various branches of government to support one another. Some of the slogans for this group are actually directed against Vladimir Putin: The slogans included in the guidelines reported by the Dossier Center align with an earlier leak of government agitation strategies reported by Kommersant. Those strategies allegedly focused on three themes devised by specially hired political strategists: respect for popular opinion, participation in a historically significant event, social justice, government turnover, and the protection of territorial sovereignty. As Meduza previously revealed, the Putin administration is aiming for a turnout rate of more than 50 percent in the nationwide constitutional vote that is set to take place April 22. To achieve that turnout, the Kremlin is leaning hardest on the social welfare component of the proposed reforms, such as measures indexing pensions to inflation and tying minimum wages to living wages over time. The decision to concentrate on those proposals was based on polling that showed many Russians are nostalgic for the social guarantees of the Soviet era.",‘Want Putin gone?

25,"In late 2019, many Internet users started noticing that the Russian state media was increasingly describing gas explosions as “gas pops” in news coverage — even when the incidents caused major damage to life and property. In fact, the number of “gas pops” mentioned in news reports jumped from a few dozen stories in early 2017 to thousands of such reports by January 2020. Meduza’s sources in the presidential administration and Russia’s security agencies say this is the result of a targeted policy to introduce more “favorable information conditions” meant to avoid a public panic when reporting gas explosions.  In the latter half of 2019, readers of Russia’s state media started drawing attention on social media to news reports about explosions, like natural-gas explosions, where the word “explosion” was bizarrely being replaced by the word “pop” (khlopok). This has repeatedly led to absurd headlines about a “gas pop” above a photograph showing a smoking ruins and a story about dozens of people being injured or even killed. For example, in December 2018, Izvestia cited regional officials from Russia’s Emergency Management Agency when describing a “gas pop” at a residential building in Magnitogorsk that killed 39 people. On social media, several readers have started asking if the strange editorial policy is the result of censorship.  When covering gas explosions in other countries, however, state-controlled and pro-Kremlin media outlets in Russia have avoided the same doublespeak. When a gas explosion injured seven people in Kazakhstan this January, for example, the Russian Defense Ministry’s television network, Zvezda, called it an explosion. Once again, Twitter users were quick to highlight the media’s apparent double standard. At Meduza’s request, the media-monitoring firm “Medialogia” studied the use of the word “pop” in Russian news headlines and found that it started supplanting the word “explosion” last fall. In stories about the same events in recent months, the frequency of “gas pop” in news headlines has grown as the use of “gas explosion” has declined. In January 2020, the Russian media mentioned “gas pops” a record 1,300 times, which was four times more than in September 2017. (For comparison, Medialogia, which indexes 53,000 different sources, tracked just 58 instances of “gas pop” in news headlines.) In other words, the Russian media has systematically and simultaneously switched from “explosions” to “pops” when reporting these disasters. What’s the difference between a pop and an explosion? A “gas pop” is, in fact, a real technical term that has appeared for years in official documents, specialized literature, and service instructions. For example, the “RAO UES” electric holding company’s “Instructions for the Investigation and Accounting of Fires at Energy Facilities,” released in 2002, offers the following definitions of the terms “pop” and “explosion”: 
A burst (or pop): The rapid combustion of a combustible mixture not accompanied by the formation of compressed gases capable of destroying structures or installations. An explosion: A rapid exothermic chemical transformation of an explosive environment accompanied by the release of energy and the formation of compressed gases capable of destroying structures or installations.  Basically, a “gas pop” is an explosion that causes no major destruction. Maybe emergency workers simply misuse the specialized terminology, which then slips into the mass media through their official statements and confuses everyone, especially in cases when the damage caused by a gas explosion is visible with the naked eye. For example, statements published on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s website over the past decade show that the agency regularly uses the word “pop” in press releases with phrases like “gas-air-mixture pop,” regardless of the damage caused by these blasts. Even the first official reports about the 2009 Sayano-Shushenskaya power station accident, which killed 75 people, used this same term in statements like: “Power station personnel inside the engine room heard a loud pop in the area of the hydraulic unit.” The agency’s press office provided Meduza with an excerpt from recommendations issued by its Civil Defense and Emergencies Research Institute, which guide the press office’s operations. The document says a “gas pop” and “gas explosion” differ in consequences and the latter can cause major damage. According to the beginning of the recommendations, however, the term “gas pop” should “be equivalent” to the technical term “gas explosion,” leaving the final choice over wording with the agency’s spokespeople.  Additionally, the agency’s local branches are also transmitting information “according to a principle of ‘incite as little panic as possible,’” a source in the Federal Emergency Management Agency told Meduza.  Perhaps the same logic guides Russia’s Investigative Committee when it issues a press release about a criminal probe into a deadly “gas pop” — the same explosion at a residential building outside Rostov pictured at the top of this story.  So is this incompetence or a deliberate policy? Sources told Meduza that the rising use of “gas pop” in news coverage is neither an accident nor the result of bureaucratic jargon slipping unnoticed from official press releases into media reports. Like other examples of government newspeak — such as “saturation” (podtoplenie) instead of flooding and “combustion” (vozgoranie) instead of fire — the term “gas pop” is part of the Russian presidential administration’s information policy.  A source close to the Kremlin’s domestic policy team under Vyacheslav Volodin (who worked as first deputy chief of staff from 2011 to 2016 and now serves as the speaker of the State Duma) described the administration's policy in the following terms: “A gas pop is a classic example of favorable information conditions, where the emphasis is placed on good news and bad news is veiled. We hear nine stories about good news plus something about some gas pop. There are no disasters.” Another source in Russia’s security apparatus confirmed to Meduza that the government pursues a policy of “reducing negativity” in the news. “I can say that there is definitely a push to understate damages,” says Meduza’s source. “If the emergency services report ‘combustion,’ it means everything’s already in flames. If they say there’s smoke, then it’s definitely on fire and maybe even a couple of people have burned up.” Several sources told Meduza that Alexey Gromov, the Putin administration’s first deputy chief of staff, holds weekly meetings with the heads of press services at key government agencies whose reports are a main source of information for the national news agencies that in turn feed the entire Russian news media. In these briefings, Gromov outlines the main topics ahead in the week and issues instructions about the “correct” presentation of the government’s agenda. “When it comes to statements about important news events that arise unexpectedly, press-service directors coordinate directly with [Alexander] Smirnov [who oversees the Kremlin’s public relations and communications department] or even Gromov,” says Meduza’s source. Another police source confirmed that the presidential administration tries to control the publication of information about emergencies, telling Meduza that not only press-service executives at government agencies but also the very heads of state news agencies sometimes coordinate the public release of information. “It’s not about saying black is white or white is black. It’s just that, in order to respond to an incident, you need to understand its scope and collect data, so it’s reasonable at first to avoid words like ‘explosion’ and write ‘pop,’ instead,” explains Meduza’s source. Speaking to Meduza, a current presidential staff member (who asked not to be named) categorically denied that the administration has instructed any press services or news agencies to write “gas pop” when describing gas explosions. “Yes, we’re also surprised when we see these stories about pops. It honestly doesn’t look great. The presidential administration has never — not now or before — conveyed any wishes in this regard,” said Meduza’s source, who also suggested that the media is taking the word “pop” from initial statements issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency when emergency workers themselves still “scarcely understand what’s happened, which is why they use this term.” A former correspondent for one of Russia’s leading news agencies, however, confirmed to Meduza the effort to ensure “favorable information conditions”: “It’s done to prevent a panic. The word ‘explosion’ is scary and negative, whereas ‘pop’ is somehow easier. In the vast majority of cases, news agencies will write about gas pops until some federal agency like FEMA, the National Anti-Terrorism Committee, or the Federal Security Service declares it an explosion.

26,"The Democratic Party's primaries are underway in the United States, where the country's increasingly left-leaning political party is flirting with democratic socialist Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders as its nominee. Additionally, recent reports citing U.S. national intelligence that Russian operatives are again trying to interfere in the American presidential election have revived the media's interest in “RussiaGate” discourse that finally faded only last year with the release of the Mueller Report. With all this talk of “the Russians,” however, what do Russian people in the U.S. actually think about the presidential race? On this episode of “The Naked Pravda,” host Kevin Rothrock spoke to seven liberal- and left-leaning Russians who currently reside in the United States about their views concerning the Democratic primaries and what they think of “RussiaGate” news coverage in the American media. “The Naked Pravda” comes out on Fridays.

27,"Russian entrepreneur Alexander Udodov, who is the husband of current Prime Minster Mikhail Mishustin’s sister, has already been accused of illegally recovering value-added tax payments from the Russian government’s budget. Now, it has also become clear that he used to own six apartments in central New York City. The apartments are in the same building where entrepreneur Denis Katsyv purchased real estate. The U.S. government accused Katsyv, who owns Prevezon Holdings and is the son of a former Russian Railways vice president,of taking part in the tax fraud case uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, whose 2009 death in a Moscow jail led to the passage of the Magnitsky Act. The connection between Katsyv and the prime minister’s family forms the center of a new report from opposition politician Alexey Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK).  Who is Alexander Udodov? Before Mikhail Mishustin became Russia’s prime minister, Alexander Udodov rarely appeared in the news. In 2011, when Mishustin took the helm at the Federal Tax Service (FNS), Kommersant and RBC mentioned Udodov as an acquaintance of Mishustin’s and a suspect in an attempt to embezzle two billion rubles through fake VAT returns. At the time, Kommersant described the businessman as “officially unemployed but a major decision-maker in the tax world.” Both outlets as well as Open Media reported that investigators believed Udodov to be involved in the crime itself, but he was nonetheless designated as a witness, not a defendant, in the case. When Mishustin exchanged the top spot at the FNS for the prime minister’s seat, journalists once again turned their attention to Udodov. Some wrote about his business dealings: He owns a company called Gribnaya Raduga (Mushroom Rainbow) that produces edible champignons as well as a mineral water bath resort called “Thermals” in the Krasnodar region. Other journalists looked into the entrepreneur’s ties with Mishustin: Udodov is still a fixture in the prime minister’s circles; he gave Mishustin’s sister Natalia Stenina luxury real estate for free; he and Stenina co-own the Sportim hockey club (where Mishustin plays); they also co-own a restaurant called The Not-So-Far East. Amid that burst of interest in Udodov, the tabloid newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets ran a story titled “Alexander Udodov: A biography of an investor who’s developing our country’s economy.” Three weeks later, Udodov gave an interview about his work to the national newspaper Izvestia. In that piece, he also denied any involvement in the illegal VAT returns and clarified the nature of his connection with Mishustin: “The truth is that since 2008, I’ve been married to his sister, Natalia. […] We don’t live together anymore, but I still have a good relationship with her family, and our moms are friends,” Udodov said. What did the FBK find out about him? Udodov previously owned six apartments at 20 Pine Street in New York City. The building is a short walk away from Wall Street. City real estate records cited by the FBK indicate that in December 2009, Udodov acquired five apartments in the building, buying a sixth in June 2010. The purchases cost the businessman $6.4 million. In every case, the properties were first registered to commercial firms with a series of similar names (PINE 2315, PINE 2401, PINE 2407), and Udodov subsequently purchased those companies. The FBK’s report indicates that Udodov rented out at least some of the apartments. By 2018, he had sold all of them. The FBK noted that Udodov bought real estate in the Pine Street building just three weeks after a Cyprus-based firm called Prevezon Holdings, owned by Denis Katsyv, had done the same. In 2013, Prevezon was targeted in a U.S. federal investigation. According to American officials, Prevezon Holdings used real estate purchases in New York City to embezzle money received from Russia via a tax fraud scheme discovered by Sergei Magnitsky. The federal investigation led government officials to freeze four of the five apartments Prevezon Holdings had purchased in the Pine Street building over the years. In 2017, however, the company settled with the government out of court, and the charges against it were dropped in exchange for $5.9 million. That is approximately three percent of the sum the U.S. government initially demanded from Prevezon Holdings, and Katsyv celebrated the end result of the case as a victory for him. “It’s practically an apology on the government’s part,” Faith Gay, an attorney for the company, told RBC. She predicted that all of the company’s frozen assets would be released. In its report on Udodov, the FBK expressed suspicion at the fact that he and Prevezon Holdings had purchased real estate in the same building in New York at about the same time. “Here’s how the situation looks at this point: Government funds were embezzled on an unprecedented scale through the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation (‘Magnitsky’s case’). The embezzlement has been thoroughly, fully demonstrated, and a dozen countries have opened criminal cases (though Russia hasn’t, of course). Some of the stolen money was given to Denis Katsyv, who immediately used it to buy apartments in New York. Three weeks later, the brother-in-law of the head of the Russian Federation’s tax service buys five apartments in the same building in New York. In fact, the apartments are legally co-owned by his wife, Mishustin’s sister. And then, there are the aggravating circumstances: This brother-in-law (Udodov) has been cited in the news media many times […] as somebody who has organized embezzlement schemes using VAT returns,” the FBK report declared.","In the same New York building where Magnitsky uncovered tax fraud, PM Mikhail Mishustin’s brother-in-law owned multiple apartments, investigation finds","7:41 pm, February 27, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/02/27/in-the-same-new-york-building-where-magnitsky-uncovered-tax-fraud-pm-mikhail-mishustin-s-brother-in-law-owned-multiple-apartments-investigation-finds

The move was first reported by the Moskva news agency. The FNS indicated that it blocked Google’s accounts in order to extract outstanding fines and taxes. Representatives for the company’s Russian branch called the account blockage a “technical issue,” according to Interfax. Kommersant wrote that the Federal Service of Courtroom Bailiffs has two orders for state duties out against Gugl, Ltd.

29,"After twice denying permits for a proposed February 29 protest in honor of assassinated opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, the government of St. Petersburg has granted permission for activists to hold a memorial march instead. Maxim Reznik, a city-level legislator, told Interfax that the march will take place in the Petrogradsky neighborhood, away from the city’s downtown. “Of course, this isn’t the march of our dreams, but the alternative to what we’re suggesting now is mass arrests and, God forbid, violence in the middle of the city. This will essentially be a mass picket and, in many ways, a memorial event,” Reznik said. A permitted memorial march will also take place in Moscow on February 29.",St. Petersburg government permits Nemtsov march after two refusals,"3:04 pm, February 27, 2020",https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/02/27/st-petersburg-government-permits-nemtsov-march-after-two-refusals
